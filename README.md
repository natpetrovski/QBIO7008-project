## Project Summary

This project compares coral bleaching detection methods using citizen science data from CoralWatch and Reef Check Australia at Heron Reef. It includes data processing, statistical modelling, and visualization of bleaching trends over time.

## Repository Contents

- `1_CoralWatch Preprocessing.R` – Data cleaning and preparation for CoralWatch data
- `1_RCA Preprocessing.R` – Data cleaning and preparation for Reef Check Australia data
- `2_Visualisation CoralWatch.R` – CoralWatch plots and analyses
- `2_Visualisation RCA.R` – Reef Check Australia plots and analyses
- `3_Comparison script.R` – Comparison plots and analyses between CoralWatch and RCA data
- `RC_substrate_cleaned.csv` - Reef Check Australia cleaned dataset
- `coral-watch-heron-cleaned.csv` - CoralWatch cleaned dataset
- `output_data/` – Restructured/filtered datasets and exported statistics/summaries/analyses

## How to Use

To reproduce this analysis, ensure the two dataset `.csv` files are in the same folder as the R scripts and run them in order.
